# MDrude.WebSocket - lightweight WebSocket Server
This is a library in order to have a very lightweight C# WebSocket Server in .NET Core with great possibilities to build upon. It uses TLP and async to maximise performance and is based upon RFC 6455 which ensures compatibility. If you have any questions, bugs or suggestions to make the library even better feel free to let me know. Thanks in advance.
